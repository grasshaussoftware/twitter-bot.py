# twitter-bot-2
latest versions of my twitter bots

these are some bots that i pieced together from various sources online into something useful
the leapbots will follow the first "friend" of the target account and then the first "friend" of that account and so on
it is a good way to get noticed inside of a friend network

Fav-RT-KW and Fav-RT-HT both use either keywords or hashtags to like and retweet selected posts. this is a good way to appear
in the notifications of people interested in the subject that you choose to follow


the others are self explanatory i believe

the credorg and credteam files can be named anything and contain your access tokens and bearer tokens as needed per bot
see my twitter-bot-1.0 repository for the templates
